Discrete Event Simulation

Project aims to apply data mining techniques to improve decision-making in a dynamic job-shop manufacturing environment. This will be done by creating a simulation model of the job shop in Python, generating data from the simulation, and using feature selection to identify important job and shop characteristics. A decision tree will then be created to develop rules for assigning due dates to jobs. The efficacy of the resulting due dates will be evaluated through computational experiments with different dispatching rules and shop utilization levels.
